      This is a closeup shot of a dish I made called pasta puttanesca, which is usually made with a
      mix of minced olives (I used Kalamata and a few other varieties of olive for this one) and
      fresh tomatoes.

    I know. Believe me, I know. I'm not a huge fan of putting a <div> here or anywhere, but it is
    the only block-level element that can group conent *without* the need for a heading.

    <div> elements should always be a last resort: only once you've made sure that you cannot make
    use of more semantic sectioning elements like <article>, <section>, <aside>, or even <main>
    should you resort to one.

    I've assigned this one a class of 'copy' because I mean it in the sense of "running copy," which
    is sometimes how the text of a piece is referred to.

      Cooking is one of my very favorite ways to enjoy myself, take care of friends and family, and
      feel like I’m doing something healthy and worthwhile. I cook almost every night of the week.
      If I find myself eating takeout or going out to a restaurant more than once a week, I tend to
      feel almost guilty.

      While in the wintertime I enjoy cooking things that take all day, like stews, I’m also an
      all-seasons griller and barbecuer. There’s something about cooking over an open fire that I
      just cannot resist. I love to grill fish, chicken, pork, and beef (and the occasional sliced
      squash or portabella mushroom for my vegetarian friends). But my real passion is for barbecue:
      slowly smoking pork shoulders, pork or beef ribs, sausages, or beef brisket for hours and
      hours. That’s especially enjoyable in the warmer spring and summer months, but I cook outdoors
      regardless of the weather: beer-can chickens in the middle of a polar vortex, or smoked
      sauerkraut and bratwurst, knackwurst, and Thüringer in the middle of a daylong rainstorm.
